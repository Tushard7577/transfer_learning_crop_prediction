Preprocess the dataset by resizing, normalizing , and Augmenting Images.
Implement transfer learning using the pre-trained VGG16, Inception, and ResNet50 models.
Train the models on the dataset for a sufficient number of epochs while monitoring performance on a validation set to prevent overfitting.
Identify the best-performing model based on accuracy.
